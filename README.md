# mocking_function


This function receives text as an input and creates it's "mocking version", just like in infamous Sponge Bob meme. Formally, this is my first function ever, so feel free to correct or optimize it. I feel that something in this code is not as good as it could be.


#Examples

* You want me to get angry, aren't you? -----> YOu waNT ME tO gEt anGRY, aReN'T yoU?
* Don't You dare to mock me, young lady! -----> DON't YOu Dare to MOCk me, yoUNG laDY!
* Sometimes I feel we are not meant to be together... -----> SOMeTiMeS i feeL we aRE NOT MeANt TO be tOgEtHer...
