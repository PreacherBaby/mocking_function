# mocking_function

========================
This function receives text as an input and brings it to mocking version, just like in Sponge Bob meme. Formally, this is my first function ever, so feel free to correct or optimize it. I feel that something in this code is not as good as it could be.

#For example

You want me to get angry, aren't you? -----> YOu waNT ME tO gEt anGRY, aReN'T yoU?
